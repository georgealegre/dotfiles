# dotfiles
These are my public configuration files for the various tools I use on every computer. Inspired by [this blog post](https://sanctum.geek.nz/arabesque/managing-dot-files-with-git/). Check out the whole blog for more amazing tips about using a CLI properly.

## Instructions:
+ On a new computer, clone this repo to your home directory (consider cloning it into a hidden directory i.e. `git clone https://github.com/georgealegre/dotfiles .dotfiles`).
+ Run the `createLinks.sh` script.
+ List all files in your home directory to verify everything worked.
+ When something is changed, just run `git pull` inside the repository.
